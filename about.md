### More Information

This small blog is to keep track of my thoughts and progress on the WMU Senior Design Project for 2017. 
The main goal of the Senior Design Project is to add value to the SMBJ project and the VFS project from Apache Commons. 
The ask comes from our client, Level Data. Generally, posts are about the SMBJ open source project and the additions I am making to that. 
I also plan to work on the VFS project and add whatever I can.
