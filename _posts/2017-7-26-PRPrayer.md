title: Say a PR Prayer
---

I have submitted a PR for the Groovy examples I created for the SMBJ project. As it turns out, one contributor had just created some
Java usage examples so I don't have bother with doing both. So I'll say a PR prayer hoping it gets accepted. Still fairly new to the whole
submitting a PR process. Things school doesn't really go over (you are just supposed to know I guess).
