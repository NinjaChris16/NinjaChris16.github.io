I have returned from a very relaxing vacation in Arizona and am ready to jump back into the SMBJ project.
My next undertaking will be looking into the exception handling for the project. 
Currently the project has a lot of unchecked exceptions and forces users to make their own try-catch blocks, so I will be looking in to fixing these issues at the main level.
I will be contacting the project lead as he has already started progress on this issue.
