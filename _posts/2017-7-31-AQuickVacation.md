title: A Quick Vacation
---

Tomorrow I'll be going on a vacation to visit some family in Arizona so there won't be much progress made on the project. 
Currently the PR from last week is still pending review. I think the examples are fairly useful so hopefully they get the green light. 
Next up for additions to the project I'm thinking either more usage examples (if the PR goes through), 
or I begin looking at the VFS project bugs and start working on that. Work will resume when I return next Monday.
