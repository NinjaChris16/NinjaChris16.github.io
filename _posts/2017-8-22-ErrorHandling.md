title: Error Handling
---

So far, plugging along on the error handling issue for the SMBJ project. The project lead has started it off with some nice handlers
and has commented on how he wants everything thrown and handled in that regard. My next steps are making sure I can test for these errors
and then work on implementing the handlers one at a time. Finding proper ways to test for the issue may be tricky as there are 3 or 4
exceptions that are unhandled right now and all throw the same message (hence the need for better handling). Work continues nontheless.
