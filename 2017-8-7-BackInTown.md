I have returned from a relaxing vacation in Arizona and am ready to get back into the SMBJ project. 
My next task I am thinking of undertaking is to work on the exception handling for the project. 
Currently there are a lot of unchecked exceptions within the project and this forces a lot of users to create try-catch blocks themselves
in order to work around the exceptions. I will be looking into a permanent fix for this issue and shall contact the project lead as he
seems to have started work on this already.
